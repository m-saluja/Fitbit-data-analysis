# Fitbit-data-analysis
In this project, I analyzed Fitbit fitness tracker data using Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data)
The dataset was used to gain valuable insights into user behavior and activity patterns. 
Using Python and popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, I processed and visualized the data to understand daily step counts, sleep patterns, and other fitness-related metrics.

The goal was to identify trends and correlations that could inform personalized fitness recommendations and improve overall user experience with Fitbit devices.
The project highlighted the importance of data-driven insights for making informed decisions in the fitness tracking industry


More information about the data:
Data set used for this project is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eliglible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore user's habits.
There are 18 csv files in total and there are organized in long format. Data has some issues and limitations. Based on ROCCC:

Reliability - LOW: The data contains only a small sample size of 30 users and limited time frame of 1 month. We don't know anything about the gender, age of users which is important since Ballbeat is a company that focuses on products for women.
Original - LOW: The data was third party collected through a distributed survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Comprehensive - MED: Dataset contains multiple fields on daily activity intensity, calories used, daily steps taken, daily sleep time and weight record.
Current - LOW: Data set is from 2016, so 7 years old now.
Cited - LOW: Data set is gathered from a third party, so it's unknown.
